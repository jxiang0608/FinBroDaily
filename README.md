For this project, I created an app that consumes a web service and exposes 6 datapoints. Upon the appâ€™s launch, the user can see a launch screen. Then, the app opens up to the StocksView, where the user is able to search for any stock ticker. When the refresh button is pressed, the app loads up stock data for the particular stock ticker that the user looked for. Then, the user has an option to add the stock to their favorites page. When the user navigates to the favorites page, they are able to see all of the stocks they favorited, as well as click into those stocks to view the individual stock details. There is also a SettingsView where the user is able to toggle between light and dark mode, as well as English and Mandarin. Additionally, the settings page allows the user to turn app notifications on/off, and lower or raise the app brightness. There is also a reset button for the app settings. Lastly, there is an app info page that tells the user about the app name, version number, build number, as well as copyright.
